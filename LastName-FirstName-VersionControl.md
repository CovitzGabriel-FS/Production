This paper addresses some of the topic matter covered in research and activity this week. Be sure to include reference links below to the research and information you used to complete this assignment.

## Topic: Terminal
Professional developers use Terminal daily. It's essential to understand some fundamental commands to use the application. 

Update the information below to demonstrate your knowledge on this topic.   

**1. Using Terminal, there are essential commands to know.**

List the correct Terminal commands to do the actions listed below. Replace **CMD** with the correct command sequence. You can keep or enhance the brief description. 

**The last bullet provides an example**.

* **clear** : Clear the Screen 
* **pwd**: Print the "Working Directory"
* **ls -hl**: List files and folders
* **ls -hla**: List files and folders, including invisible files
* **ls -hl**: List all files and folders, in human readable form
* **cd**: Change directory
* **cd /**: Change directory, go to root directory
* **cd ~**: Change directory and go to user home directory
* **cd ..**: Change directory, go up one folder level
* **cd../..**: Change directory, go up two folder levels
* **cd ~/Desktop/**: Change directory to my desktop! 


**2. Using Terminal...**

**Folder Drop:** Describe what happens when you drag a folder into Terminal. If you type "cd " before dragging the folder into Terminal and press return after dragging a folder to Terminal, could that help you quickly navigate to the folder location? Test this out and describe your results below. 

**before typing cd the folder permission was denied, but after typing cd and inserting the folder it navigated to the folders location.**


## Topic: Version Control & Git
Version control, also known as revision control, records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. In this class, we are learning Git. Update the information below where indicated.  

**1. There are three types of version control.**

[ **There is Local Version Control: That type of version control is copying one version and and inserting it into another directory, or simply saving a file with a new version number. Centralized version control is when developers need to collaborate on a single server. and third is Distributed, This way lets the developer to make a copy of the repository and store that on a local drive.**]



**2. Using Terminal, there are also essential Git commands to know.**

List the correct Git commands to do the actions listed below in Terminal. Replace CMD with the correct command and keep or enhance the brief description. **The last bullet provides an example**. 

* **git clone [url]**: Clone a repository
* **git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”**: Set-up a global user name
* **git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”**: Set-up a global email address (to match my GitHub account eMail)
* git status :[ show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit ]
* **git add [file]**: Add modified files to the next commit
* **git commit -m “[descriptive message]”**: Make a commit with a new message
* ** git show [SHA]**: Show my commit history
* **git help**: This command will bring up Git's help screen in Terminal!
    



**3. Connecting to GitHub using Terminal.**
HTTPS is the the correct way to connect to GitHub in this course. Describe how you connect to GitHub from Terminal using this protocol. What steps do you take? 

[ **To connect to github you need to fist have to get the websites address and write that in the file. after the address you need to write put the url. git also automatically converts the url into  clickable link.** ]



**4. Using .gitignore and Why it's Important**  
Most repositories contain a .gitignore file. 

* What is the purpose of this file?  
* What is the "**.DS_Store**" file and why would you want to ignore it?
* What other file or folder would you want to add to a .gitignore file and why? 


[ **file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.**
  **This file stores custom attributes/metadata of its containing folder and the names of other files. Exposing this information could  allow hackers to get into that information and let them see files.**
  **You want to add operating files to your .gitignore, Application files, Language and framework files,files that deal with package managers, credentials. The reason why you want to ignore these is because they are private files no body else needs to see or shouldnt have access to. Ignoring these will prevent people from getting their hands on important information that you dont want to share to the public.**
